## 🧠 Introduction to Kubernetes

**Kubernetes** (also known as **K8s**) is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

- Created by Google, based on their internal system **Borg**
- Maintained by CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation)
- “K8s” is shorthand: 8 letters between **K** and **s**

### 🔥 Why Use Kubernetes?

- Self-healing containers
- Auto-scaling based on traffic
- Declarative configuration (YAML)
- Rolling updates without downtime
- Portable across clouds and on-prem

## ⚔️ Docker vs Kubernetes

| Feature             | Docker Alone                 | Kubernetes                          |
|---------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| App Packaging        | ✔️                           | ✔️ (uses Docker under the hood)     |
| Container Orchestration | ❌ Manual setup            | ✔️ Fully automated                  |
| Load Balancing      | ❌ Limited                   | ✔️ Built-in                         |
| Resilience & Healing| ❌ None                      | ✔️ Restarts crashed Pods            |
| Scaling             | ❌ Manual                    | ✔️ Horizontal auto-scaling          |

🧩 Kubernetes solves the complexity of running containers at scale, across environments.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

### 🔹 Control Plane

- `API Server`: Entry point for `kubectl` & automation
- `Controller Manager`: Maintains cluster state
- `Scheduler`: Assigns Pods to nodes
- `etcd`: Stores cluster configuration
- `Cloud Controller`: Integrates cloud features

### 🔸 Worker Node

- `kubelet`: Ensures Pods are running
- `kube-proxy`: Networking inside cluster
- `Container Runtime`: Runs containers (`containerd`, `Docker`)

---

## 🧪 Hands-On Deployment (O'Reilly Sandbox)

### ✅ Step 1: Create Deployment

```bash
kubectl create deployment hello-world --image=k8s.gcr.io/echoserver:1.4
```

### ✅ Step 2: Expose as NodePort

```bash
kubectl expose deployment hello-world --type=NodePort --port=8080
```

---

## 🔍 Commands & Checks

### 🎯 Verify Deployment

```bash
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

### 🔎 Check Service & Port

```bash
kubectl get svc hello-world
```

Expected output: `NodePort` assigned (e.g., `30446`)

### 🧭 Find Node IP

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

Look for internal IP like `172.16.28.5`

---

## 🌐 Accessing the App

**Option 1: NodePort (may be restricted in sandbox)**

```bash
curl http://<NodeIP>:30446
```

**Option 2: Port Forwarding (Recommended)**

```bash
kubectl port-forward pod/<pod-name> 8080:8080
curl http://localhost:8080
```

✅ You'll see echo server responding with headers and request info

---

## 🧯 Troubleshooting & Sandbox Tips

> 💡 O'Reilly sandboxes often block external traffic on NodePort

### Common Fixes
- Use port-forwarding instead
- Confirm pod is running
- Check image pull status
- Use internal proxy URL (if provided)

---

## 🚨 Production Guidelines

| Practice         | Sandbox Use      | Production Use                 |
|------------------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| Port-forwarding   | ✔️ Local testing | ❌ Not scalable                |
| NodePort          | ✔️ Basic access  | ❌ Use LoadBalancer or Ingress |
| LoadBalancer      | ❌ Cloud only    | ✔️ External app exposure       |
| YAML deployment   | Optional         | ✔️ Infrastructure as code      |
| RBAC & security   | ❌ Ignored       | ✔️ Must configure roles        |

---

## 💬 Interview Questions

1. What is the role of `kubelet`?
2. Why is etcd critical for the cluster?
3. How does Kubernetes handle failed containers?
4. Difference between ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer?

# 🧠 Kubernetes Step 1: Hello World App Deployment

## 📖 Overview

This step introduces the foundation of Kubernetes using a simple echo server deployment. You'll learn how to:
- Deploy a containerized app using a `Deployment`
- Expose it via `NodePort` service
- Access it using `port-forwarding` (sandbox-friendly)
- Scale Pods for high availability

---

## 🚀 Why Kubernetes?

Traditional Docker:
- Manages containers on a single host
- No auto-scaling or healing
- Limited network exposure options

Kubernetes (K8s):
- Orchestrates containers across multiple nodes
- Self-healing and scalable
- Abstracts infrastructure complexity

📌 “K8s” = shorthand for Kubernetes ("K" + 8 letters + "s")

```

## 🧪 Hands-On Practice (O'Reilly Sandbox)

### ✅ Step 1: Create a Deployment

```bash
kubectl create deployment hello-world --image=k8s.gcr.io/echoserver:1.4
```

> 🧠 This spins up a Pod through a Deployment controller.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Expose the Deployment

```bash
kubectl expose deployment hello-world --type=NodePort --port=8080
```

> Creates a Service to expose the app externally via dynamic port (e.g., `30446`)

---

### 🔍 Step 3: Check Resources

```bash
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
kubectl get svc hello-world
```

✅ Confirm:
- Pod is in `Running` state
- Deployment and Service exist
- NodePort is assigned

---

### 🧭 Step 4: Port-Forward for Access (Recommended for Sandbox)

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/hello-world 8080:8080
curl http://localhost:8080
```

🎉 You’ll receive a response showing request headers — proof your echo server is alive!

---

## 🔧 Step 5: Bonus – Scale Your Deployment

```bash
kubectl scale deployment hello-world --replicas=3
kubectl get pods
```

✅ Observe: 3 Pods running for high availability

---

## 🧯 Troubleshooting Tips

- **Can't access NodePort externally?**  
  Use `kubectl port-forward` to test locally (common in sandbox environments)

- **Pod not starting?**  
  Check logs with:  
  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
  ```

## 💡 Real-Time Production Guidance

| Task                 | Sandbox Use   | Real-Time Production      |
|----------------------|---------------|----------------------------|
| Port Forwarding      | ✔️ Test only   | ❌ Not scalable            |
| NodePort             | ✔️ Basic demo | ⚠️ Limited, use LoadBalancer |
| LoadBalancer         | ❌ Cloud only | ✔️ External access         |
| Manual `kubectl`     | ✔️ Lab        | ❌ Use CI/CD pipelines     |
| Scaling Pods         | ✔️ CLI manual | ✔️ Auto-scaling via metrics |

## 📝 Note for Readers

> ⚠️ NodePort may not work in some environments like O'Reilly’s sandbox due to restricted firewall rules. In such cases, use `kubectl port-forward` or proxy tunnels for local access.
