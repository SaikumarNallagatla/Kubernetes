## üß† Introduction to Services

In Kubernetes, a **Service** is an abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them. Because Pods can die and restart with new IPs, Services allow stable networking and load balancing.

> üìå Services = networking glue + traffic director

## üß© Service Types & Real-World Use

| Type            | Description                                 | Real-World Use Case                              |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `ClusterIP`       | Internal-only access within cluster          | Microservices backend-to-backend communication   |
| `NodePort`        | Exposes app on static port per node         | Dev/test exposure in labs                        |
| `LoadBalancer`    | Cloud-native public access                  | Real production apps on AWS, GCP, Azure          |
| `ExternalName`    | Maps to external DNS name                   | Legacy app or third-party service integration    |
| Headless Service  | No ClusterIP; direct Pod access             | StatefulSets, DNS-based load balancing           |

---

## üîç How Services Work

Kubernetes uses `selectors` to tie a Service to matching Pods. It then creates **endpoints** with Pod IPs and manages load balancing across them using `kube-proxy`.

> üéØ When traffic hits the Service, kube-proxy redirects it to one of the backend Pods

Example DNS format:
```
<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local
```

## üíª Sandbox Hands-On Guide

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Deployment

```yaml
# deployment-echo.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: echo-deploy
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: echo-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: echo-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: echo-server
        image: k8s.gcr.io/echoserver:1.4
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment-echo.yaml
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create ClusterIP Service

```yaml
# service-echo.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: echo-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: echo-app
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 8080
    targetPort: 8080
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f service-echo.yaml
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Access Service Without Port Forwarding

```bash
kubectl run test-client --image=alpine -it --restart=Never -- /bin/sh
```

Then inside Pod:

```sh
apk add curl
curl echo-service.default.svc.cluster.local:8080
```

‚úÖ Success: response from echo server inside the cluster.

---

## üè≠ Production Environment Example

### Scenario: Expose Frontend Publicly via LoadBalancer

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: frontend-lb
spec:
  selector:
    app: frontend
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
```

Used in:
- Cloud-based environments
- Auto-provisioned external IP
- Allows user traffic into cluster safely

### Example Flow:

```plaintext
User Browser --> LoadBalancer IP --> Service --> Frontend Pods
```

## üßØ Troubleshooting Checklist

| Problem                    | Diagnosis Command                          | Fix                                     |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Service not reachable      | `kubectl get endpoints <service>`         | Check Pod labels match selector          |
| DNS name fails inside Pod  | `kubectl run` with Alpine, install curl   | Use image with full DNS support          |
| No Pods behind Service     | `kubectl get pods --show-labels`          | Ensure label selector matches correctly  |
| Wrong targetPort mapping   | Inspect YAML and Pod containerPort        | Sync ports: Service port ‚Üî Pod containerPort |

## ü§ñ DevOps Principles in Services

| Principle         | Applied In Services                                  |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Declarative Infra** | YAML definitions define networking setup       |
| **Self-Healing**      | Services auto-update endpoints if Pods change  |
| **Scalability**       | Services route traffic evenly to N Pods         |
| **Portability**       | Works on all cloud providers and on-prem       |
| **Security**          | Network policies, RBAC can restrict exposure   |
| **Observability**     | Integrates with logging/metrics systems        |

## üñºÔ∏è Architecture Diagram

```plaintext
+---------------------+
| External User       |
+----------+----------+
           |
     [ LoadBalancer ]        <-- cloud provider, external IP
           |
     [ Service: frontend-lb ] <-- type=LoadBalancer
           |
     [ Pods: frontend-app ]   <-- app containers
```

Internal Microservice-to-Microservice:

```plaintext
Pod A --> Service B --> Pod B
```

## üí¨ Interview Questions & Answers

### Q1: What does a ClusterIP Service do?
> Provides stable internal networking to a group of Pods.

### Q2: Why might a NodePort not work in a sandbox?
> External firewall blocks exposed ports; sandbox doesn‚Äôt support external access.

### Q3: How does Kubernetes route traffic from a Service?
> `kube-proxy` uses iptables or IPVS to route requests to endpoint Pods.

### Q4: What's the difference between `targetPort` and `port`?
> `port` = port exposed by Service; `targetPort` = port inside container.
