## Kubernetes Networking Basics

### 🔗 Cluster Networking Overview

Kubernetes networking allows all Pods in a cluster to communicate with each other. It provides IP addresses to each Pod and manages their communication using networking components.

---

### 🌐 Pod-to-Pod Communication

* Every Pod gets a unique IP address
* All Pods can talk to each other without NAT (flat network)
* Pod IPs are ephemeral (they change if Pod restarts)

---

### 🚚 CNI (Container Network Interface)

CNI is a specification and a set of plugins used by Kubernetes to configure networking for containers.

#### ✅ What CNI does:

* Assigns IP address to each Pod
* Manages routing rules
* Ensures connectivity across nodes

#### ❓ Is CNI assigned automatically?

Yes, when you install a Kubernetes cluster, **you must choose a CNI plugin**, or the cluster installation tool (like kubeadm, k3s, or a cloud provider) will install one for you.

#### ✨ Popular CNI Plugins:

* **Flannel** – Simple overlay network
* **Calico** – Advanced, supports NetworkPolicy
* **Weave** – Peer-to-peer overlay
* **Cilium** – eBPF-based, highly scalable

> Example: When you create a cluster with kubeadm, you manually install a CNI like Calico or Flannel.

> Cloud providers like EKS, AKS, and GKE provide default CNI setups automatically.

---

### 📢 Services

Kubernetes Services provide stable networking for Pods:

* **ClusterIP** (default): Internal access only
* **NodePort**: Exposes app on a static port on each Node
* **LoadBalancer**: Provision cloud load balancer
* **ExternalName**: Maps a service to a DNS name

---

### 🧬 Summary

* Pod IPs are given by CNI plugins
* CNI must be installed — either manually or automatically
* Services abstract access to Pods using stable endpoints

Next Topic: NetworkPolicy - for controlling who can talk to whom inside the cluster

# Kubernetes NetworkPolicy

## 🔎 What is a NetworkPolicy?

A **NetworkPolicy** in Kubernetes is used to control how Pods communicate with each other **and with other network endpoints** (like services or external addresses). By default, **all pods can talk to each other**, but with a NetworkPolicy, you can restrict this communication based on rules.

It acts like a **firewall rule for pods** inside the cluster.

---

## 📊 Why Use NetworkPolicy?

- ✅ Improve **security** by **restricting unnecessary traffic**
- ✅ Enforce **zero-trust networking** inside the cluster
- ✅ Limit blast radius in case of a compromise
- ✅ Separate traffic flows (frontend-to-backend, app-to-database)

---

## 🎓 Real-Life Example:

Imagine you have 3 apps:
- `frontend`
- `backend`
- `database`

You want:
- Frontend to access backend
- Backend to access database
- Frontend should NOT directly access database

You can use NetworkPolicies to **enforce this flow**.

---

## ⚖️ Basic Components

A NetworkPolicy has:
- `podSelector`: which pods the rule applies to
- `ingress`: who is allowed to send traffic to the pod
- `egress`: where the pod is allowed to send traffic
- `namespaceSelector`: restrict by namespace
- `ipBlock`: restrict by IP ranges (CIDR)

---

## 📑 Sample YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-frontend-to-backend
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: frontend
```

This allows **only pods with label `app=frontend` to talk to pods with `app=backend`**.

---

## 🌐 By Default:
- If no NetworkPolicy is applied → **All traffic allowed**
- If even one policy selects a pod → Only traffic allowed by policy is allowed, rest is **DENIED**

---

## 🏛️ Common Use Cases:
- Frontend to Backend only
- Deny all external traffic
- Allow egress to internet only from specific pods
- Allow internal monitoring tools (like Datadog) to access all

---

## 💡 As a DevOps Engineer:
- You should implement **least-privilege networking**
- Add NetworkPolicies as part of deployment pipelines
- Review network access using observability tools

---

## 🌈 Visual Example:
```
[frontend] ---> [backend] ---> [database]
     |                        ^
     |______x no access______|
```

---

## ❌ Common Mistakes
- Not labeling pods correctly (policies won’t apply)
- Expecting NetworkPolicy to work without a CNI that supports it (like Calico, Cilium)

---

## 💡 Tip:
Not all CNI plugins support NetworkPolicies (e.g., Flannel does not support it by default). Use **Calico** or **Cilium** for full support.

Ready to move to the next concept: **Ingress Controller vs API Gateway**?




# Ingress vs API Gateway in Kubernetes

## 🔎 Overview

Both **Ingress** and **API Gateway** are used to expose your Kubernetes services to the outside world, but they serve slightly different purposes and operate at different layers of abstraction.

---

## ⚖️ Key Differences

| Feature                             | Ingress                                            | API Gateway                              |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**                         | Route external HTTP/HTTPS traffic to services      | Full-featured API management             |
| **Protocol Support**                | HTTP/HTTPS only                                    | HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, gRPC, TCP        |
| **Layer**                           | Layer 7 (Application)                              | Layer 7 (Advanced API Gateway Layer)     |
| **Authentication**                  | Not built-in (can add with plugins or annotations) | Built-in (OAuth2, JWT, API Key)          |
| **Rate Limiting**                   | Not built-in                                       | Built-in                                 |
| **Request/Response Transformation** | Limited                                            | Advanced capabilities                    |
| **Usage**                           | Simple routing                                     | Complex API management                   |
| **Example Tools**                   | NGINX Ingress, Traefik                             | Kong, Ambassador, Istio, AWS API Gateway |

---

## 🔬 Use Cases

### When to Use **Ingress**:

* You just need to expose HTTP routes to internal services.
* Want to manage simple path or host-based routing.
* Looking for a lightweight solution.

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  rules:
  - host: myapp.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /app1
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: app1-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

### When to Use **API Gateway**:

* You need full API lifecycle management.
* Need to handle authentication, rate limiting, logging, analytics.
* Microservices are externally exposed and consumed by third parties.

Example tools:

* **Kong**: Supports plugins for auth, rate limiting, etc.
* **Ambassador**: Developer-friendly API Gateway for Kubernetes.
* **Istio**: Full service mesh with gateway capabilities.

---

## 📖 Real-Time Example

Imagine you have three microservices:

* `user-service`
* `order-service`
* `payment-service`

### Ingress Use:

* `/user` ➔ user-service
* `/order` ➔ order-service
* `/pay` ➔ payment-service

### API Gateway Use:

* Add token-based authentication for `/pay` endpoint.
* Rate limit `/order` endpoint.
* Log all `/user` requests for analytics.

---

## 🤔 Common Doubts Cleared

### 1. Can we use both together?

Yes. Ingress can be used for basic routing and an API Gateway can sit behind it for complex policies.

### 2. Is Ingress enough for production?

Yes, if your requirements are simple. But if you need fine-grained control and monitoring, go with API Gateway.

### 3. Can Ingress handle auth and rate limiting?

Some Ingress controllers like NGINX can do this with annotations or plugins, but it's limited.

---

## ✅ DevOps Engineer Perspective

* Use Ingress for basic ingress/egress.
* Choose API Gateway when you need control, observability, and advanced security.
* In CI/CD, manage Ingress/API Gateway YAML files as part of deployment templates.

---

## 📊 Summary

| Scenario                           | Choose      |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Just routing inside K8s            | Ingress     |
| Need security, auth, rate limiting | API Gateway |
| External public APIs               | API Gateway |
| Internal service routing           | Ingress     |
| Full API monitoring + analytics    | API Gateway |

Want to continue with the next topic: **Service Mesh (Istio, Linkerd)**?


# 📦 Kubernetes: Service Mesh (Istio, Linkerd)

## 🔍 What is a Service Mesh?

A **Service Mesh** is a dedicated infrastructure layer that handles **communication between microservices** in a Kubernetes cluster. It provides:

* Traffic management
* Security (mTLS)
* Observability (metrics, logs, traces)
* Reliability (retries, timeouts, circuit breaking)

> It works without changing your application code.

---

## 🤖 How it Works (Anatomy)

Service Mesh injects a **sidecar proxy** (e.g., Envoy) into every pod.

```
+---------------------+       +---------------------+
|   App Container     |       |   App Container     |
|    (Service A)      |       |    (Service B)      |
+---------------------+       +---------------------+
| Sidecar Proxy (Envoy)| <--->| Sidecar Proxy (Envoy)|
+---------------------+       +---------------------+
```

All network communication **passes through these sidecars**.

---

## 💡 Why Use a Service Mesh?

| Feature            | What It Does                                              |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Traffic Control    | Canary deployments, A/B testing, mirroring                |
| Load Balancing     | Distributes requests among service replicas               |
| Security (mTLS)    | Encrypts traffic between pods automatically               |
| Retries & Timeouts | Handles failures gracefully                               |
| Observability      | Metrics, logs, tracing with tools like Jaeger, Prometheus |
| Policy Enforcement | Enforce rules like who can talk to whom                   |

---

## 🧪 Examples

### 1. **Istio Traffic Split Example**

Split traffic 90% to v1 and 10% to v2:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  hosts:
    - my-service
  http:
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: my-service
            subset: v1
          weight: 90
        - destination:
            host: my-service
            subset: v2
          weight: 10
```

### 2. **mTLS Enabled**

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
```

---

## 🧠 Real-time Example:

You’re managing 100 microservices:

* Want to encrypt all internal traffic
* Roll out a new version slowly (canary)
* Monitor which service is causing latency

✅ Use Istio or Linkerd — let the mesh manage all of this!

---

## 💬 Common Doubts

### Q1: Can I use Ingress and Service Mesh together?

✅ Yes. Service Mesh often uses **Ingress Gateway** to expose services, replacing default Ingress controllers.

### Q2: Does Service Mesh affect performance?

⚠️ Yes, slightly — because of extra proxy hops. But it’s worth it for security and observability.

### Q3: Is it compulsory in DevOps?

🔸 Not mandatory for small setups.
🔹 **Highly recommended** in microservice-heavy, production environments.

---

## 🔚 Conclusion

A Service Mesh provides platform-level features like traffic control, security, and monitoring **without touching app code**. As a DevOps Engineer, it's your job to understand, install, and manage this layer — especially in large-scale, production-grade Kubernetes environments.
