## üåê Kubernetes Services & Ingress - Deep Dive (For GitHub)

---

### üìå Concept: What is a **Kubernetes Service**?

In Kubernetes, **Pods are ephemeral**‚Äîthey come and go. Every Pod gets a **new IP address** each time it's restarted or recreated. This is a challenge for stable communication.

That‚Äôs where **Services** come in.

A **Service** is a permanent endpoint that exposes a set of Pods to other parts of the cluster (or even to the external world). It acts as a **stable bridge** between consumers (like other Pods, or users outside the cluster) and the backend Pods.

---

### üß† Think of it like:

Imagine a **call center**. The agents (Pods) may change every day, but you always dial the **same customer care number (Service IP)**. Internally, it forwards your call to any available agent (Pod).

---

### üß± Why do we need a Service?

* Pods are temporary (new IPs each time).
* Clients need **a stable DNS name/IP**.
* Load balancing between multiple Pods.

---

### üîß Types of Services:

1. **ClusterIP (default)**

   * Accessible **only within the cluster**.
   * Use case: Internal communication (e.g., frontend Pod talking to backend Pod).

2. **NodePort**

   * Exposes the service on a **static port** on every Node.
   * Use case: Temporary debugging or development access.

3. **LoadBalancer**

   * Provisions an **external IP** via a cloud provider‚Äôs load balancer.
   * Use case: Production apps needing external traffic.

4. **ExternalName**

   * Maps to an **external DNS name**.
   * Use case: Redirect traffic to services outside the cluster.

---

### ‚úÖ DevOps Engineer Real-Time Example:

Let‚Äôs say you deployed a backend app with 3 Pods using a Deployment.

To expose it inside the cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: ClusterIP
```

* This forwards requests from port 80 (service) to port 8080 (container).
* The `selector` makes sure only Pods with `app: myapp` label are targeted.

---

### ü§ñ How does a Service track new Pods?

Services use **labels** and **selectors**. When a new Pod with matching labels is created, the Service automatically adds it to the backend pool using kube-proxy.

So, even if a Pod gets a new IP, as long as it has the same labels, the Service routes traffic correctly.

```yaml
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
```

---

### üåç Now Let‚Äôs Move to: **Ingress**

---

### üìå Concept: What is Kubernetes **Ingress**?

A **Service** can expose your app, but what if you have **multiple apps (microservices)** and want to route traffic based on the **URL path or domain name**?

This is where **Ingress** comes into play.

**Ingress** is an API object that manages **external access** to services, typically **HTTP and HTTPS traffic**. It works **at Layer 7** of the OSI model (application layer).

---

### üß† Think of it like:

A **gatekeeper** who checks incoming requests and sends them to the correct door based on the address (URL).

---

### üîß What can Ingress do?

* Route `api.myapp.com` to backend-service
* Route `myapp.com/login` to login-service
* Handle TLS/SSL termination
* Add path rewrites or host-based routing

---

### ‚úÖ DevOps Engineer Real-Time Example:

Let‚Äôs say you want to expose two microservices:

* `/app1` ‚Üí app1-service
* `/app2` ‚Üí app2-service

You‚Äôd write an Ingress like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
          - path: /app1
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: app1-service
                port:
                  number: 80
          - path: /app2
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: app2-service
                port:
                  number: 80
```

---

### üí° How Ingress Works:

* **Ingress Controller** (like NGINX, Traefik) listens to Ingress rules.
* Exposes a **single external IP** or DNS name.
* Based on the incoming request path/host, it forwards traffic to the right **Service**, which forwards to the correct **Pods**.

### ü§ù Ingress vs Service:

| Feature       | Service                 | Ingress                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Level         | Layer 4 (TCP)           | Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)            |
| Use Case      | Internal/Basic external | Advanced routing (URLs/domains) |
| External IP   | Exposes each service    | Single point of access          |
| Routing Rules | Not supported           | Yes (paths/hosts)               |

---

### üîê SSL/TLS Handling with Ingress:

Ingress allows you to terminate SSL at the edge and serve your app securely.

```yaml
spec:
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - myapp.com
      secretName: tls-secret
```

---

### üöÄ Final Flow:

* User hits `myapp.com/app1`
* Ingress rule matches `/app1`
* Forwards to `app1-service`
* Which forwards to `app1-pod`
