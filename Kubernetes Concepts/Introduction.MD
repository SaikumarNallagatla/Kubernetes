# Chapter 1: Introduction to DevOps and Why Kubernetes Exists

# 🔹 1.1 What is DevOps?

## 💡 Definition:

DevOps is a cultural and technical movement that combines "Development" and "Operations" to improve collaboration, accelerate software delivery, and increase reliability.

## 🧩 Key Objectives of DevOps:

Faster software delivery

Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)

Better collaboration between teams

More reliable systems with automation and monitoring

## 🔁 DevOps Lifecycle:

Plan – Requirements & goals.

Develop – Write the code.

Build – Compile and package.

Test – Automated/unit/integration tests.

Release – Push to production.

Deploy – Deploy automatically.

Operate – Maintain and monitor.

Monitor – Observe health & performance.



# 🔹 1.2 Problems Before DevOps

Before DevOps, companies followed Waterfall or Traditional IT models:

**❌ Challenges:**

Manual deployments (slow and error-prone)

Siloed teams (Dev and Ops didn’t communicate well)

Late testing (bugs found very late)

Inconsistent environments ("It works on my machine")

Hard to scale

**📌 Example:**

Imagine a software release like a train. In traditional IT, development builds the engine, testing checks it after it’s running, and operations tries to fix it mid-journey. Everyone blames each other when it crashes.

DevOps ensures everyone builds, tests, and drives the train together.

# 🔹 1.3 Infrastructure Evolution: Why Kubernetes?

To understand why Kubernetes exists, we must understand how infrastructure evolved.

**🏗️ Stage 1: Physical Servers (Traditional Infrastructure)**

One app per physical server

Very expensive and wasteful

Manual setup and maintenance

**Problems:**

Poor resource usage

Long provisioning time

No isolation (security)

**💾 Stage 2: Virtual Machines (VMs)**

Multiple VMs run on a single physical machine using a Hypervisor (e.g., VMware, VirtualBox)

Each VM has its own OS, making it heavy and resource-intensive

Advantages:

Better resource utilization

Isolation and security

**Disadvantages:**

Still heavy (each VM runs full OS)

Slower boot time

**📦 Stage 3: Containers (Docker Era)**

Lightweight virtualization

Shares the host OS kernel

Uses container engines like Docker

**Advantages:**

Fast startup time

Lightweight and portable

Consistent across environments

**Disadvantages:**

No built-in orchestration

Managing multiple containers becomes complex



# 🔹 1.4 The Rise of Containers and Docker

Docker popularized containers by making them easy to build and run.

**🧱 Docker Terminologies:**

Image: Blueprint of the app

Container: Running instance of an image

Dockerfile: Set of instructions to build an image

Registry: Where images are stored (DockerHub)

🔁 Docker Workflow:

Write Dockerfile

Build image

Push to registry

Pull on server

Run as container

**Real-Time Example:**
A company needs to run 10 microservices (auth, payment, cart, inventory...). Each has different libraries and versions. Docker allows running all of them independently without conflict.

But... Who manages all these containers?

# 🔹 1.5 Container Orchestration

As apps grow:

You need to run hundreds or thousands of containers

Monitor their health

Restart if failure

Scale based on demand

Network between containers

Doing this manually is not practical.

**❗ The Problems:**

How to schedule containers?

How to load balance?

How to recover from crashes?

How to roll out updates?

This is where Kubernetes comes in.

# 🔹 1.6 What is Kubernetes?

**📘 Definition:**

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Created by Google (based on their internal system called "Borg")

Donated to CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation)

Also called "K8s" (K + 8 letters + s)

**🎯 Core Functions:**

Auto-scaling

Self-healing (restarts failed containers)

Rolling updates and rollbacks

Service discovery and networking

Secret & config management

**🏢 Industry Use Cases:**

Netflix: Handles millions of requests using microservices on K8s

Airbnb: Dynamic scaling for travel demand

Spotify: Manages audio streaming services

# 🔹 1.7 Advantages and Disadvantages of Kubernetes

✅ Advantages:

Portability across clouds

High availability

Auto-healing and scaling

CI/CD friendly

Efficient resource usage

**❌ Disadvantages:**

Steep learning curve

Requires proper monitoring and configuration

Overkill for small projects


Kubernetes is not just a tool, it’s a standard for modern infrastructure.
