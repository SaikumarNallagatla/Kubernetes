1. Introduction to Kubernetes

What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

At its core, Kubernetes helps you manage your containerized workloads and services, ensuring they run where and when you want them to, and scale up or down as needed.

Why Kubernetes? The Problems it Solves
Before Kubernetes, managing containerized applications at scale was challenging due to issues like:

Scaling: Manually scaling applications up or down based on demand.

Self-healing: Detecting and recovering from container failures.

Load Balancing: Distributing network traffic across multiple instances of an application.

Service Discovery: How applications find and communicate with each other.

Automated Rollouts/Rollbacks: Managing application updates with minimal downtime.

Resource Utilization: Efficiently using server resources.

Kubernetes addresses these problems by providing a robust framework for automating these operations.

Key Benefits of Kubernetes
Portability: Run your applications consistently across public clouds, private clouds, and on-premise environments.

Scalability: Easily scale your applications horizontally with simple commands or automated scaling policies.

Resilience: Automatically recovers from failures, ensuring high availability of your applications.

Agility: Accelerates development cycles by automating deployment and management tasks.

Cost Optimization: Better resource utilization leads to reduced infrastructure costs.

2. Kubernetes Fundamentals: The Building Blocks
The Kubernetes Cluster: A High-Level View
A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called nodes, that host containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node.

The worker nodes host the Pods that are the components of the application workload. The control plane manages the worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster.


Core Concepts Explained

Po**ds**

The smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes. A Pod (like a pea pod) encapsulates one or more containers (e.g., Docker containers), storage resources, a unique network IP, and options that govern how the containers should run.

**Why Pods?**

Co-location: Containers in a Pod are always co-located and co-scheduled on the same node.

Shared Resources: They share network namespace, IP address, and can share storage volumes.

Single Logical Application: Ideal for closely coupled processes that need to share resources.

# Example: A simple Pod definition
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-nginx-pod
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80

**Deployments**

Deployments are higher-level objects that manage the lifecycle of Pods. They ensure that a specified number of Pod replicas are running at any given time and provide declarative updates to Pods and ReplicaSets.

**Key features**:

**Declarative Updates**: You describe the desired state, and Kubernetes makes it happen.

**Rollouts & Rollbacks:** Safely update applications and easily revert to previous versions if needed.

**Self-healing**: Deployments use ReplicaSets to ensure the desired number of Pods are always running.

# Example: A simple Deployment definition
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3 # Desired number of Pod replicas
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

# Services
Services define a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them. They enable loose coupling between dependent Pods. Even if Pods fail or are rescheduled, the Service provides a stable endpoint for communication.

Service Types (briefly introduced here, detailed later):

**ClusterIP**: Internal-only IP, default type.

**NodePort**: Exposes the Service on a static port on each Node's IP.

**LoadBalancer**: Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer.

**ExternalName**: Maps a Service to an arbitrary external CNAME.

# Example: A simple ClusterIP Service
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx # Selects Pods with label app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80 # Service port
      targetPort: 80 # Pod port
  type: ClusterIP

# Namespaces
Namespaces provide a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single Kubernetes cluster. They are used to divide cluster resources between multiple users or teams.

Benefits:

Resource Isolation: Prevents naming conflicts between different projects.

Access Control: RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) can be applied per namespace.

Resource Quotas: Limit resource consumption (CPU, memory) per namespace.

# Example kubectl commands for namespaces
kubectl create namespace development
kubectl get pods --namespace development # or -n development

Kubeconfig
A kubeconfig file is a YAML file that contains information about clusters, users, and contexts (combinations of clusters and users). The kubectl command-line tool uses kubeconfig files to find the information it needs to choose a cluster and authenticate to that cluster's API server.

Typically located at ~/.kube/config.

3. Diving Deeper: Kubernetes Cluster Architecture
Understanding the individual components of a Kubernetes cluster is crucial for advanced operations and troubleshooting.

Control Plane (Master Node) Components
The Control Plane components make global decisions about the cluster (e.g., scheduling), as well as detecting and responding to cluster events.


(Suggestion: Replace this placeholder with an actual diagram showing interactions between Control Plane components)

kube-apiserver: The Front Door
The API server is the front end for the Kubernetes control plane. It exposes the Kubernetes API. The API server is designed to scale horizontally; that is, it scales by deploying more instances.

Key Functions:

Exposure of Kubernetes API: All communication (from kubectl, other control plane components, or external tools) goes through the API server.

Validation: Validates API objects.

Persistence: Stores the state of the cluster in etcd.

etcd: The Brain's Memory
etcd is a consistent and highly-available key-value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data. All cluster state, configuration, and metadata are stored here.

Importance: If etcd is down, the Kubernetes cluster effectively stops working. It's critical to ensure its reliability and backup.

kube-scheduler: The Workload Distributor
The scheduler watches for newly created Pods that have no assigned node and selects a node for them to run on.

Scheduling Factors: Resource requirements (CPU, memory), hardware/software/policy constraints, affinity and anti-affinity specifications, data locality, inter-workload interference, deadlines.

kube-controller-manager: The Orchestration Engine
The controller manager runs controller processes. Controllers watch the shared state of the cluster through the API server and make changes attempting to move the current state towards the desired state.

Examples of Controllers:

Node Controller: Responsible for noticing and responding when nodes go down.

Job Controller: Watches for Job objects that represent one-off tasks, then creates Pods to run those tasks.

EndpointSlice Controller: Populates EndpointSlice objects (which provide a link between Services and Pods).

ServiceAccount Controller: Creates default ServiceAccounts for new Namespaces.

cloud-controller-manager (Optional): Cloud Integration
The cloud controller manager only runs controllers that interact with cloud provider APIs. This allows cloud vendor code to be developed and released independently of core Kubernetes.

Examples: Node Controller, Route Controller, Service Controller (for cloud load balancers).

Worker Node Components
Worker nodes run the actual applications (Pods).


(Suggestion: Replace this placeholder with an actual diagram showing interactions between Worker Node components)

kubelet: The Node Agent
An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It ensures that containers are running in a Pod.

Key Functions:

Registers the node with the API server.

Receives Pod definitions from the API server.

Instructs the container runtime to start/stop containers.

Monitors the health of Pods and reports back to the API server.

kube-proxy: The Network Proxy
kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in your cluster, implementing part of the Kubernetes Service concept.

Key Functions:

Handles network proxying for Kubernetes Services.

Manages network rules (e.g., using iptables or IPVS) to allow network communication to Pods from inside or outside of the cluster.

Container Runtime (CRI): Running Containers
The container runtime is the software that is responsible for running containers. Kubernetes supports several container runtimes:

Docker: While Docker Engine used to be the default, Kubernetes now primarily uses containerd or CRI-O through the Container Runtime Interface (CRI).

containerd: A high-level container runtime that can manage the complete container lifecycle.

CRI-O: A lightweight alternative to Docker for Kubernetes, specifically designed to be compatible with CRI.

4. Networking in Kubernetes
Networking is one of the most complex but critical aspects of Kubernetes. Kubernetes' network model is designed to be flat, meaning every Pod gets its own IP address, and Pods on different nodes can communicate directly without NAT.

The Kubernetes Network Model
Pods can communicate with all other Pods on all nodes without NAT.

Agents on a node (e.g., system daemons, kubelet) can communicate with all Pods on that node.

Pod's IP address is the same from inside and outside the Pod.

Container Network Interface (CNI)
Kubernetes relies on CNI plugins to implement its network model. CNI is a specification for configuring network interfaces for Linux containers.

Popular CNI Plugins: Calico, Flannel, Cilium, Weave Net. Each has different features, performance characteristics, and network policy capabilities.

Service Types
Services abstract away the Pods they represent and provide a stable network endpoint.

ClusterIP
Description: Exposes the Service on an internal IP in the cluster. This is the default Service type.

Access: Only reachable from within the cluster.

Use Case: Internal microservices communication.

# Example: ClusterIP
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-internal-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: ClusterIP

NodePort
Description: Exposes the Service on a static port on each Node's IP. A ClusterIP Service is automatically created.

Access: Reachable from outside the cluster using <NodeIP>:<NodePort>.

Use Case: Exposing a service for development/testing, or when a cloud load balancer is not desired/available.

# Example: NodePort
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-webapp-nodeport
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-webapp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
      nodePort: 30080 # Optional, auto-assigned if not specified (30000-32767)
  type: NodePort

LoadBalancer
Description: Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer. A NodePort and ClusterIP Service are automatically created.

Access: Provides a dedicated external IP address.

Use Case: Production-ready external access for web applications in cloud environments.

# Example: LoadBalancer (requires cloud provider integration)
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-webapp-lb
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-webapp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer

ExternalName
Description: Maps a Service to an arbitrary DNS name, not to a set of Pods. No proxying is involved.

Access: Returns a CNAME record.

Use Case: Providing a consistent Service endpoint for an external database or third-party service.

# Example: ExternalName
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-external-db
spec:
  type: ExternalName
  externalName: my.database.example.com

Ingress: External Access to Services
Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to Services within the cluster. It provides a way to consolidate routing rules.

Key Features:

URL-based Routing: Route traffic based on paths or hostnames.

SSL Termination: Handle HTTPS traffic.

Load Balancing: Works with Ingress Controllers (e.g., NGINX Ingress Controller, Traefik).

# Example: A simple Ingress rule
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-app-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: myapp.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: my-webapp-service
            port:
              number: 80

Network Policies: Securing Inter-Pod Communication
Network Policies specify how groups of Pods are allowed to communicate with each other and with other network endpoints. They are firewall rules for Pods.

Key Features:

Control ingress (inbound) and egress (outbound) traffic.

Select Pods based on labels.

Define rules based on Pod selectors, IP blocks, and namespaces.

Requirement: A CNI plugin that supports NetworkPolicy (e.g., Calico, Cilium) must be installed.

# Example: Deny all ingress to a Pod
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-all-ingress
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app-restricted
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress

5. Storage in Kubernetes
Containerized applications are often stateless, but many applications require persistent storage for their data. Kubernetes provides abstractions to manage storage resources.

Volumes: Ephemeral Storage
A Kubernetes Volume is a directory, accessible to the containers in a Pod, and lives as long as the Pod lives. If the Pod dies, the volume's content is also lost.

Types: emptyDir, hostPath, configMap, secret, gitRepo (deprecated).

Use Case: Temporary storage, sharing data between containers in the same Pod.

# Example: emptyDir volume
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod-with-volume
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: alpine
    command: ["sh", "-c", "echo 'Hello from volume' > /data/message.txt && sleep 3600"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: my-data
      mountPath: /data
  volumes:
  - name: my-data
    emptyDir: {}

Persistent Volumes (PV): Cluster-Wide Storage
A PersistentVolume (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes. It's an API object that abstracts the details of how storage is provided.

Life Cycle: Independent of any individual Pod. Data persists even if Pods are deleted or moved.

Provisioning: Can be statically created or dynamically provisioned.

Persistent Volume Claims (PVC): Requesting Storage
A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user. It consumes PV resources. PVCs allow developers to consume storage resources without knowing the underlying infrastructure details.

Binding: A PVC attempts to find a matching PV (based on size, access modes, storage class). Once bound, the PV and PVC are exclusively linked.

# Example: Persistent Volume Claim
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce # Can be mounted as read-write by a single node
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi # Request 1 Gigabyte of storage
  storageClassName: standard # Name of the StorageClass

Storage Classes: Dynamic Provisioning
A StorageClass provides a way for administrators to describe the "classes" of storage they offer. When a user requests a PVC for a specific StorageClass, Kubernetes can dynamically provision a PV that matches the request.

Benefits:

Automates PV creation.

Allows different types of storage (e.g., fast SSD, standard HDD, NFS) to be offered.

Hides infrastructure complexity from developers.

# Example: A simple StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: standard
provisioner: k8s.io/minikube-hostpath # Or a cloud provider provisioner like kubernetes.io/aws-ebs
reclaimPolicy: Delete # Or Retain
volumeBindingMode: Immediate

StatefulSets and Persistent Storage
StatefulSets are workloads designed to manage stateful applications, providing stable network identities and stable, persistent storage.

Key Features:

Stable, Unique Network Identifiers: For each Pod in the StatefulSet.

Stable, Persistent Storage: Provisioned using PVCs.

Ordered Deployment and Scaling: Pods are created/deleted in a strict, defined order.

Use Case: Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), message queues (e.g., Kafka), distributed key-value stores.

6. Workload Management in Kubernetes
Kubernetes provides various workload resources to manage different types of applications and tasks.

Deployments: Managing Stateless Applications
(Revisited) Deployments are ideal for stateless applications. They manage the desired state of ReplicaSets, enabling declarative updates with features like rolling updates and rollbacks. Most web applications fall into this category.

ReplicaSets: Ensuring Desired State
A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of Pod replicas are running at any given time. Deployments use ReplicaSets under the hood. You generally don't interact with ReplicaSets directly when using Deployments.

StatefulSets: Managing Stateful Applications
(Revisited) For applications that require stable, unique network identifiers, stable persistent storage, and ordered graceful deployment/scaling/deletion. Used for databases, distributed systems.

DaemonSets: Running on All (or Selected) Nodes
A DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) nodes run a copy of a Pod. When nodes are added to the cluster, Pods are automatically added to them. When nodes are removed, these Pods are garbage collected.

Use Cases: Logging agents (Fluentd), monitoring agents (Prometheus node exporter), storage daemons (Ceph).

# Example: DaemonSet for a logging agent
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: fluentd-logger
  labels:
    app: fluentd
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: fluentd
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: fluentd
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: fluentd
        image: fluentd/fluentd-kubernetes-daemonset:v1.16-debian-syslog-1.0

Jobs: One-Off Tasks
A Job creates one or more Pods and ensures that a specified number of them successfully terminate. When the specified completions are reached, the Job is complete.

Use Case: Batch processing, data migrations, one-time scripts.

# Example: Simple Job
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: pi-job
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pi
        image: perl
        command: ["perl", "-Mbignum=bpi", "-wle", "print bpi(2000)"]
      restartPolicy: Never
  backoffLimit: 4 # Number of retries before marking as failed

CronJobs: Scheduled Tasks
A CronJob creates Jobs on a repeating schedule. It's similar to cron in a Linux system.

Use Case: Scheduled backups, sending emails, periodic reports.

# Example: CronJob for a daily backup
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: daily-backup
spec:
  schedule: "0 0 * * *" # Every day at midnight UTC
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: backup
            image: alpine/git
            command: ["sh", "-c", "echo 'Performing daily backup...' && sleep 10"]
          restartPolicy: OnFailure

7. Configuration and Secrets Management
Applications often require configuration data (e.g., database connection strings) and sensitive information (e.g., API keys). Kubernetes provides ConfigMaps and Secrets for this.

ConfigMaps: Storing Non-Confidential Data
ConfigMaps are used to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs. They decouple configuration artifacts from image content to keep containerized applications portable.

Ways to use:

As environment variables in a container.

As command-line arguments in a container.

As files in a volume mounted inside a container.

# Example: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-app-config
data:
  database_url: "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb"
  api_endpoint: "https://api.example.com/v1"

Secrets: Storing Sensitive Information
Secrets are designed to store sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and ssh keys. They are similar to ConfigMaps but provide basic encryption at rest within etcd and specific usage patterns for enhanced security.

Types: Opaque (default), kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson, kubernetes.io/tls.

Ways to use: Similar to ConfigMaps (environment variables, volume files).

Best Practice: Avoid putting raw sensitive data directly into YAML files. Use tools like helm secrets or external secret management systems (e.g., Vault) for production.

# Example: A generic Secret (data must be base64 encoded)
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-db-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: YWRtaW4= # echo -n 'admin' | base64
  password: c2VjcmV0cGFzc3dvcmQ= # echo -n 'secretpassword' | base64

8. Security in Kubernetes
Securing your Kubernetes cluster and applications is paramount. This section covers key security aspects.

Authentication and Authorization (RBAC)
Authentication: Verifies the identity of a user or a service trying to access the Kubernetes API.

Methods: X509 Client Certs, Bearer Tokens, OpenID Connect (OIDC).

Authorization: Determines if an authenticated user is allowed to perform a specific action on a resource.

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): The primary authorization mechanism.

Role: A set of permissions within a namespace.

ClusterRole: A set of permissions across the entire cluster.

RoleBinding: Grants permissions defined in a Role to a user or service account within a namespace.

ClusterRoleBinding: Grants permissions defined in a ClusterRole to a user or service account across the entire cluster.

ServiceAccounts: Provides an identity for processes that run in Pods. Pods interact with the API server using a ServiceAccount.

# Example: Role and RoleBinding for a developer in 'dev' namespace
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: dev
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group
  resources: ["pods", "pods/log"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods-in-dev
  namespace: dev
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: dev-user # Name of the user as authenticated
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io

Pod Security Standards (PSS)
Pod Security Standards (PSS) define three different policies (Privileged, Baseline, Restricted) to restrict the capabilities of Pods. These replace the older Pod Security Policies (PSPs).

Privileged: Unrestricted.

Baseline: Minimally restrictive, prevents known privilege escalations.

Restricted: Heavily restricted, follows current best practices for hardening Pods.

Network Policies (Revisited)
Crucial for securing network communication between Pods, limiting the blast radius in case of a compromise.

Image Security and Admission Controllers
Image Security: Use trusted image sources, scan images for vulnerabilities, and sign images.

Admission Controllers: Intercept requests to the Kubernetes API server before objects are persisted to etcd. They can validate, mutate, or reject requests.

PodSecurity admission controller enforces Pod Security Standards.

Other custom admission controllers can enforce policies like requiring specific labels, preventing certain image sources, etc.

9. Monitoring, Logging, and Observability
Observability is key to understanding the health and performance of your applications and cluster. It encompasses monitoring, logging, and tracing.

Why Observability?
Troubleshooting: Quickly identify root causes of issues.

Performance Optimization: Understand bottlenecks and improve resource utilization.

Capacity Planning: Predict future resource needs.

Security Auditing: Track access and activity.

Monitoring: Prometheus & Grafana (High-Level)
Prometheus: An open-source monitoring system with a time series database. It scrapes metrics from configured targets (Kubernetes components, applications).

Grafana: An open-source analytics and visualization web application. It integrates with Prometheus (and many other data sources) to create dashboards for visualizing metrics.

Logging: ELK Stack / Fluentd / Loki (High-Level)
ELK Stack: A popular stack for centralized logging:

Elasticsearch: Distributed search and analytics engine for logs.

Logstash: Data processing pipeline for collecting, enriching, and sending logs to Elasticsearch.

Kibana: Visualization layer for Elasticsearch.

Fluentd: An open-source data collector for unified logging. Often deployed as a DaemonSet on Kubernetes nodes to collect container logs and send them to a centralized logging solution.

Loki: A horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. It indexes log metadata (labels) rather than the full log content.

Tracing (Brief Mention)
Distributed tracing (e.g., with Jaeger, Zipkin) helps visualize the flow of requests through complex microservice architectures, aiding in performance debugging and understanding latency.

10. Advanced Kubernetes Concepts & Ecosystem
The Kubernetes ecosystem is vast and constantly evolving. Here are some key advanced topics.

Helm: The Kubernetes Package Manager
Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications. Helm Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.

Benefits:

Application Packaging: Define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes applications.

Dependency Management: Manage dependencies between charts.

Release Management: Track and roll back application versions.

Shareable: Easy to share and reuse application configurations.

Operators: Extending Kubernetes API
An Operator is a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes-native application. Operators extend the Kubernetes API by creating Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and custom controllers that know how to manage specific applications.

Use Cases: Automating the deployment and management of complex stateful applications (e.g., database operators, Kafka operators).

Service Mesh: Istio, Linkerd (Introduction)
A Service Mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer that makes service-to-service communication safe, fast, and reliable. It often uses a "sidecar" proxy alongside each application Pod.

Benefits:

Traffic Management: A/B testing, canary deployments, blue/green deployments.

Observability: Built-in metrics, logging, tracing for inter-service communication.

Security: Mutual TLS, access policies.

Popular Service Meshes: Istio, Linkerd, Consul Connect.

CI/CD with Kubernetes: GitOps (ArgoCD, Flux)
CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery): Automating the process of building, testing, and deploying applications.

GitOps: An operational framework that takes Git as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. Changes are made by pushing to Git, and automated processes (like ArgoCD or Flux) reconcile the cluster state with the Git repository.

Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
CRDs allow you to extend the Kubernetes API by defining your own custom resource types. This is how Operators create new kinds of objects that they can manage.

11. Troubleshooting and Best Practices
Knowing how to diagnose and resolve issues is a vital skill for anyone working with Kubernetes.

Common Troubleshooting Commands
kubectl get <resource>: View current resources (e.g., kubectl get pods, kubectl get svc).

kubectl describe <resource> <name>: Get detailed information about a resource, including events, conditions, and associated objects.

kubectl logs <pod-name> [-c <container-name>]: View logs from a Pod's container.

kubectl exec -it <pod-name> [-c <container-name>] -- <command>: Execute a command inside a running container.

kubectl events: View recent events in the cluster (useful for understanding what Kubernetes is doing).

kubectl top pod/node: View resource usage (CPU/memory) for pods or nodes (requires metrics-server).

Debugging Pods and Services
Pod Status: Check kubectl get pod <pod-name> for status (Pending, Running, Succeeded, Failed, CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff).

Pod Events: kubectl describe pod <pod-name> to see events that led to the current state (e.g., image pull errors, scheduling failures).

Service Endpoints: Check kubectl describe svc <service-name> and look at Endpoints to ensure it's pointing to healthy Pods.

Resource Limits and Requests
requests: The minimum amount of CPU/memory a container needs. Used by the scheduler to place Pods on nodes.

limits: The maximum amount of CPU/memory a container can use. If a container exceeds its memory limit, it will be terminated. If it exceeds its CPU limit, it will be throttled.

Best Practice: Define both requests and limits for all your containers to ensure stable performance and efficient resource utilization.

Liveness and Readiness Probes
livenessProbe: Tells Kubernetes when to restart a container. If the liveness probe fails, Kubernetes will restart the container.

readinessProbe: Tells Kubernetes when a container is ready to start accepting traffic. If the readiness probe fails, the Pod will be removed from Service endpoints until it passes.

Types: httpGet, tcpSocket, exec.

Scaling Strategies
Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): Automatically scales the number of Pod replicas based on observed CPU utilization or custom metrics.

Cluster Autoscaler: Automatically adjusts the number of nodes in your cluster based on pending Pods and node utilization.
